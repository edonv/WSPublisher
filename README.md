`WSPublisher` is a client library for easy `Combine`-based communication via [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket). It also has async/await overloads. It's written in pure Swift, has no third-party dependencies, and is built entirely on top of Swift's native [URLSessionWebSocketTask](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessionwebsockettask).

While this library can be used for any WebSocket communication, it was built as a modular piece of the puzzle that is my [OBSwiftSocket library](https://github.com/edonv/OBSwiftSocket).
